# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Finnish team and community take security as a number one priority.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/nicolasauler/finnish/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Finnish team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Keep in mind that this project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis.
