# Finnish

Finnish is your finn-man (financial manager), but in the 21st century.
Its purpose is to use the Open Finance API's to securely and automatically retrieve expenses and savings information
from your banking institution.

This way, you're on top of your financials and can make better decisions of how to manage your hard-earned money.

## Software

:warning: Finnish is still in beta and will have a 0.2 beta launch soon, check in with Milestones.

Finnish is not a financial product, its a software one.
It's baffling that there is no product for this in the wild (at least not that I know of, here in Brazil).
Why should a user have to keep track of their various financial institutions, via their banking app, investment app, etc,
when they could have a single secure hub to manage it all?

The purpose of this solution is to, by using cutting-edge technology and prioritizing quality of software,
deliver this missing piece.
